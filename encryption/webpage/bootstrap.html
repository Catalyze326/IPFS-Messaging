Modern tap shoes—with their smooth, endlessly customizable metal plates in the toe and heel—made their mainstream debut in the 1925 show No, No Nanette, and within a few years, most Broadway-style dancers were amplifying their steps with the help of metal plates. The style known simply as tap existed before that, of course, but tappers had to practice their craft wearing clogs, boots, or hard-soled shoes outfitted with hobnails or bottle caps. Like many American styles, the moves were a fusion of different cultures, combining irish clog dancing and english step dancing with the improvisational, rhythmic dances passed down through generations of African Americans. The dance quickly spread throughout social clubs, street corners, and eventually traveling minstrel shows before hitting Broadway and, from there, Hollywood.
