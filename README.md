# IPFS-Messaging

This is a messaging app created for decentralized distributed communication. It uses the Inter Planetary File System to allow peer to peer communication on a decentralized framework that is incredibly fault tolerant. Built for low bandwidth areas where fast messaging is crucial. This has applications for everything from marine traffic to allowing communication between those affected by a natural disaster and those who are trying to help to allowing messaging in third world countries where no infrastructure has been created.
